# challenge-22-redux-store

## Description

In this weeks challenge I was tasked to refractor the code of a previous activity. In the activity I was to implment redux to manage global state 


## Installation

In order for this application to work you need to have mongoDB, mongoose, stripe, jwt, express, apollo, bcrypt, graphQL, and react.

  

## Usage

This is a great application because it allows the coder to keep track of his code more easy and stay orgainized. They are able to do this because then they do not have to continuously pass props.
